This is the project of the AdvPT module (Advanced Programming Techniques) WS2022. 

**_Note: Thank you for checking out this repository. The project is still a work in progress and requires significant improvements and optimizations, such as implementing multi-grid techniques on calculation A and b, in order to work properly for all image resolutions. Please keep in mind that this project was created as a university project and is not intended for production use._**
